# Profile Image Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Image

1. **Add your profile image to this folder:**
   - Place your image file in: `src/assets/images/`
   - Name it: `profile-image.jpg` (or `.png`, `.jpeg`)
   - Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio)
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, JPEG

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1) works best
   - High resolution (at least 300x300 pixels)
   - Professional headshot or clear photo
   - Good lighting and clear visibility

3. **File Naming:**
   - The code expects: `profile-image.jpg`
   - If you use a different name, update the `src` attribute in `home.component.ts`

4. **After adding your image:**
   - The image will automatically appear in your portfolio
   - It will be displayed as a circular profile photo
   - Hover effects and responsive sizing are already configured

## Current Setup
- Image path: `assets/images/profile-image.jpg`
- Styling: Circular with blue border
- Responsive: Scales appropriately on mobile devices
- Hover effect: Slight zoom on hover
